# DocParseAI

Welcome to **DocParseAI**, an open-source organization focused on creating **AI-powered document parsing, summarization, and text analysis** solutions. Our goal is to make document understanding more efficient and accessible using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** technologies.

---

## üöÄ **Our Mission**

DocParseAI is dedicated to building intelligent tools that can automatically process and summarize large documents. We utilize the latest advancements in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** to help users extract key insights, summaries, and relevant information from any document‚Äîwhether it's a legal brief, research paper, or business report.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Core Technology**

DocParseAI‚Äôs core technology focuses on **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** for document summarization:
- **Retrieval**: Extracts the most relevant sections of a document.
- **Augmented Generation**: Uses large language models (LLMs) to generate concise and meaningful summaries from the retrieved sections.

We support various document types, including:
- **PDFs**
- **Word Documents (.docx)**
- **Plain Text Files**
