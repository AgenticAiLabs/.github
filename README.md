# DocParseAI

Welcome to **DocParseAI**, an open-source organization focused on building powerful, AI-driven solutions for document summarization and text analysis. Our mission is to provide intelligent tools that leverage **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** techniques to simplify and automate document parsing, summarization, and information extraction.

## üöÄ About DocParseAI

DocParseAI is dedicated to making **document understanding** more efficient and accessible through **AI-powered** technologies. We aim to help users get quick summaries, key insights, and contextually relevant information from any document‚Äîwhether it's a research paper, business report, legal document, or any other type of text.

### Core Technology
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Our core technology combines **retrieval** of relevant document sections with **generation** of summaries using state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs).
- **Document Parsing**: We utilize advanced NLP techniques to extract, parse, and summarize text in various formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT).
